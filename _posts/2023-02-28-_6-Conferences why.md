Attending conferences is an important part of the PhD experience. Conferences can offer numerous benefits, both personally and professionally. In this article, I’ll explore the reasons why you should attend conferences during your PhD, and what you can expect to get out of it.

**1. Exposure to experts**

Firstly, attending conferences is a great opportunity to be exposed to world experts in your field. While you have access to expertise through your supervisor and lab group, seeking the opinion of other experts is beneficial. Science is increasingly international, and rarely do all the world-leading experts in a field reside in the same country.Hence frequently the only opportunity to meet these individuals is at an international conference. Discussing your research with them can provide valuable insights that you may not get otherwise.

**2. Practise your presentation skills**

[I’ve previously written about why developing great presentation skills during your PhD is important](). Presenting a poster or talk at a conference is an excellent way to practise your presentation skills, particularly if you've only presented within your lab group or institution. Presenting in an unfamiliar environment, among a large number of speakers, can be challenging, so it's crucial to get practice.

**3. Stay up-to date with your field; see great talks and posters**

At a conference, attendees often present their latest research which may not be available online. Thus, conferences provide access to recent advances in the field, which can be insightful or inspiring for your own work.
Moreover, attending talks and observing posters can also help develop your own presentation skills. It’s important to consider not only the scientific content but also the way it is presented, as this can offer insights into what makes a good presentation or poster. Whenever I’m at a conference, I always make sure to spend time looking through all the posters and taking notes. Usually I take photos of posters I particularly like, which I then use to reflect on how to improve my own posters.

**4. Networking**

Attending conferences lets you meet people who share your research interests and expertise, which could lead to new collaborations or even job opportunities. If you plan to stay in your field of research, those at the conference may be potential future employers. Presenting a poster or talk is a great way to make a good impression and generate interest in your research or start a conversation.

**5. The opportunity to travel**

This one is more personal than professional I think. During a PhD, especially one involving cell culture or any wet-lab work, it can be tricky to take time off. Experiments tend to be built up over a series of weeks or months, and so it’s often very difficult to take a week off without setting yourself back. Conferences are a good way to fit in some time-off, since you’re already away from the lab and so the additional disruption to your schedule is minimal.
