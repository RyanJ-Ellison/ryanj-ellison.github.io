Today’s post is the first video post! Today I’m talking about how to use Notion’s powerful database features to create a database for your literature references. The video can be found below:

I’ve used a few different referencing systems throughout my masters and PhD. I’ve previously used reference managers such as Zotero and Endnote, but ultimately I found they didn’t match my needs. Personally, I prefer to be able to write notes and other information in the same place where my references are stored. Even if I sort my references in descriptive lists or subfolders, I would find myself going back to these lists and thinking “why is this reference here? What’s important about it?”.

This is the main reason I switched to using Notion. You can seamlessly add detailed notes or summary information on a paper by embedding a new page. The other great feature of Notion is databases, which I use to group papers by subject matter (e.g. Effect of specific FGFR3 mutations”) using Notion’s tags feature. This allows you to easily search through your papers for those on a certain topic, without having to sort every paper into multiple different topic lists.

The template that I show in the video can be found [here](https://cloud-freon-844.notion.site/951c9ff7a526423e920be06aec9f3c0e?v=4b52d4bd25b6443d862f708aa4785f6b).

From here, you can duplicate the template so that you can use it to make your own literature review database in Notion! Happy reading!
