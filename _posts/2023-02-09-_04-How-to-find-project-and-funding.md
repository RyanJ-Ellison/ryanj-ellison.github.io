## How to find a (funded) PhD project
So you've [done your research](https://ryanj-ellison.github.io/2023/01/31/_02-Four-things-to-consider.html) and decided that you do in fact want to apply for a PhD. But how? Where do you look? Well you've come to the right place. This post will tell you where to look for PhD projects, as well as explain how different types of PhD funding work.

**How does PhD funding work?**

So the first thing to talk about is how PhD funding works in the UK. Funding for PhD projects can be divided into 3 broad categories. 

(1) If no funding is available for the project, then the supervisor can list the project as "self-funded". This means that you are not paid a stipend, and you have to pay a "tuition fee" to the university. As you can imagine, this sucks. But in all seriousness, this option isn't really advisable for those without an income source to keep them afloat throughout the length of the PhD (3-4 years). 

(2) Fully-funded. This usually means that the supervisor has acquired funding for the project ahead of time, which means that if you are successful in applying for the project, then your funding is also sorted. This funding could be from a charity, research council, university department, etc. 

(3) The third and increasingly-common funding option is competition funding. Here you will typically apply for several projects that are listed by a central funding agency, for example Cancer Research UK (CRUK) or the Medical Research Council (MRC). In these types of applications, both the funding body and the project supervisor will have a role in assessing your application. Sometimes these are also run in stages, e.g. you first apply to the supervisor, and then each supervisor puts forward one candidate to the funding body, who then select the candidates and projects they want to fund. As such, you can sometimes be chosen by the supervisor but not chosen overall. The opposite may also happen, where the funding body thinks your application is good enough but your prefered supervisor may have chosen another candidate. In this case you may be invited to choose another supervisor/project.

With the latter two options (I personally wouldn't consider self-funding) the funding will cover your stipend (salary that you don’t pay taxes on, and can be less than minimum wage), tuition fee, and your research costs. 

**Where to find projects - findaphd**

The first place that I would look for projects is [FindaPhD.com](https://www.findaphd.com/). This is an incredble resource that lists literally thousands of PhD projects that you can search through based on keywords you put in. Searching brings up a list of results where information on each project is displayed such as who the supefvisors are, which university the project is based at, when the application deadline is, and what type of funding (if any) is available. You can also make an account and save projects to a “favourites list”. Note that some funded projects may stipulate who their funding goes to, such as UK-only or european only. If a project doesn't have funding available, then it will be self-funded. While funded projects will typically have a deadline, self-funded projects can usually be applied to all year round.

When you click onto the site you'll be brought to the homepage, which will look something like this:

![findaphdhome](../assets/images/findaphdhome.png)

From here the site essentially functions like a search engine for PhD projects that have been listed on there. Here are some of the results if we search for "breast cancer":

As you can see, for each project, various types of information are listed. (1) Project name, (2) University the project is at, (3) Project description, (4) Project supervisors, (5) application deadline, if any (6) funding status of the project. You can click on the "more details" button to the right to go to the project page, where the full desciption (as well as other info) is listed.

You can find the full project description here. This page also lists the skills that you will learn during the project, some info on their "ideal candidate", some info on the project application process, as well as the documents you have to submit (e.g. personal statement and CV). 

As you can see, findaphd can make finding projects really easy, and provides you with a comprehensive overview of said projects. As such I highly reccommend it.

**Where to find projects - Other options**

Outside of findaphd, there are a few other places you could look. If you have a specific university or specific supervisor (maybe one of your lecturers?) in mind, then it’s always worth checking out their website to see if they have any projects listed. Or with the supervisors it’s worth sending them an email. Even if you’ve never met them and you’ve seen their project online, it’s always worth getting in touch before putting an application in, to help break the ice a little. Plus I think if they get your application in without having ever spoken to you it might seem a bit rude.

As a final option, a lot of academics and institutes now list available PhD projects on their Twitter accounts. Everything listed there is probably going to be elsewhere in an easier-to-read format, but you might accidentally find a cool project while scrolling.
