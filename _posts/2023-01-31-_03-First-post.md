## Start of the PhD blog

So after umming and ahhing (are those actually words?) I've decided to start a "PhD blog" (very iventive title). 

As a little bit of background, I'm a 3rd year biomedical sciences PhD student at the University of York, [studying bladder cancer](https://ryanj-ellison.github.io/Research.html). I currently run a student outreach program called "Meet a PhD". The idea of the program is for undergraduate students to have a safe space to ask questions to current postgraduate students and get real answers. We also have current students give talks about their experience of postgraduate study.
The program has so far been successful, to the point that I thought maybe there are more students out there that would find some of this information useful. So I decided to build a website and a blog, as a forum to provide information about doing a PhD. My aim is to provide information about issues surrounding PhD students, to help those that are considering applying for a PhD to make an informed choice about whether it would be right for them. I also want to inform about how the PhD application works, and how to find projects and funding.

If this sounds interesting to you, then stay tuned for more content!
