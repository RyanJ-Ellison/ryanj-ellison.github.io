# Academic Life
## Research Interests
I began my research journey during my Undergrad at the University of Oxford. I became interested in the fundamental underlying biology of cancers, ad how this could be used to target them. I was first able to put this into practice during a placement in the lab of [Professor Eric Cascales](https://www.cascaleslab.fr/) in Marseilles, where I worked to produce genetically engineered E. coli capable of targetting and killing colorectal cancer cells. This work was made possible by a [Laidlaw Scholarship](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/exeter-student-named-laidlaw-scholar-2018/) I was awarded. You can read more about my Laidlaw research project [here](C:\Users\ryanj\Desktop\Github\RyanJ-Ellison.github.io\docs\assets\img\Laidlaw-Yearbook-2018-My-Profile.pdf).

I'm currently based at the [Jack Birch Unit](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/jack-birch-unit/) in the [York Biomedical Research Institute](https://www.york.ac.uk/biomedical-research-institute/) of the University of York Biology Department. The Jack Birch Unit studies the epithelial lining of the bladder and urinary tract, called the urothelium. We study the normal biology of the urothelium to understand how it is altered in various disease states, such as bladder cancer.

My research focuses on the role of two specific growth factor receptors, the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3). I'm interested in how the activity of these 2 receptors interacts with and may shape tumour differentiation status. By identifying and dissecting these unique interactions, I aim to adavnce our understanding of fundamental bladder cancer biology. It is my hope that this will inform on the use and mechanism of bladder cancer therapeutics, such at the [use of FGFR3 inhibitors for patients harbouring FGFR3 mutations](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-targeted-therapy-metastatic-bladder-cancer).

Recently, I have also begun to study the role of FGFR3 mutations in development of bladder cancer from healthy tissue.

## Education
I am currently studying for a PhD in Biomedical Sciences at the University of York (2020-2023). My PhD concerns the roles of growth factor receptors in bladder cancer and how they interact with tumour differentiation status.

I studied for an Undergraduate and Integrated Masters Degree in Biochemistry (MBiochem), at the University of Oxford (2016-2020), where I obtained an Upper Second Class Degree. My masters research project was based in the Lab of [Professor Ulrike Gruneberg](https://www.path.ox.ac.uk/content/ulrike-gruneberg), studying the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint, specifically the action of the protein MAD1.


## Outreach
- **Running "Meet a PhD" Sessions** - Currently I run these sessions in the University of York Biology Department. The idea is to make a space for undergraduate students to come and ask questions about postgraduate study, and get honest answers. We also have free pizza!
- **University Outreach Talks** - I've given several talks on topics such as studying a science degree at university, careers options after a science degree, and what studying for a PhD is actually like. I've previously spoken at Carmel Sixth Form College (St Helens) and Selby College (York).
- **Public Enagement** - I enjoy communicating to the public about the importance of bladder cancer research, and what we actually do! This has included presenting my research to the public at the York Against Cancer Annual General Meeting, and also spreading awareness of the risk factors of bladder cancer during our Bladder Cancer Awareness Day event.

## Academic Presentations
- **International Bladder Cancer Network 2022 (Barcelona)** - Flash Talk and Poster presentation
- **University of York Biology Research Away Day 2022 (York)** - Poster Presentation
- **British Association for Cancer Research 60th Anniversary Conference (Nottingham)** - Poster Presentation; Awarded funding to attend

## Awards
- **British Association for Cancer Research (BACR) Travel grant** - I was awarded a travel grant to attend the BACR 60th Anniversary Meeting in  Nottingham in 2022, where I presented part of my PhD research as a poster.
- **Laidlaw Scholarship** - During the 2nd Year of my undergarduate degree, I was awarded funding to perform research in the Cascales Lab in Marseilles. Here I began development of genetically engineered E. coli bacteria to target and kill colorectal cancer cells.

# Personal Life

## Kendo
I took up Kendo in my second year of university when I was looking for a way to stay fit. Put simply, Kendo is the way of the sword, the aim being to develop a strong human character through rigorous training with a bamboo sword.
![Me with Ikkyu certificate](/docs/assets/img/Kendo_Ikkyu_certificate.jpg)


I competed in several UK tournaments both as an individual and as part of the Oxford University Kendo club. This included first place in the University Taikai non-blackbelt division individuals and third place in the team competition. I also represented the University of Oxford in the annual Varisty competition against the University of Cambridge, which Oxford won.

During the second year of my PhD at the University of York I became captain of the University Kendo club, which I help to run along with the other committee members. As part of my role as captain I am responsible for planning and running the Kendo club practice sessions. This involves teaching Kendo to people of all abilities, the vast majority of who have never practiced Kendo before.
