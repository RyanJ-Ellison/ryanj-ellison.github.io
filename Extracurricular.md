## Kendo
I took up Kendo in my second year of university when I was looking for a way to stay fit. Put simply, Kendo is the way of the sword, the aim being to develop a strong human character through rigorous training with a bamboo sword.

I competed in several UK tournaments both as an individual and as part of the Oxford University Kendo club. This included first place in the University Taikai non-blackbelt division individuals and third place in the team competition. I also represented the University of Oxford in the annual Varisty competition against the University of Cambridge, which Oxford won.

During the second year of my PhD at the University of York I became captain of the University Kendo club, which I help to run along with the other committee members. As part of my role as captain I am responsible for planning and running the Kendo club practice sessions. This involves teaching Kendo to people of all abilities, the vast majority of who have never practiced Kendo before.

##Running
At the start of my PhD the JBU lab took part in a group running challenge to raise money for York Against Cancer [make yac into a hyperlink], the charity that funds our lab. I found that I actually really enjoyed the running, and now do it recreationally to stay fit. 
In 2022 I took part in the York Run For All 10K to raise money for York Against Cancer.
