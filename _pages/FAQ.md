**What is a PhD?**
For most people, a PhD is a 3-4 year period of research, during which you try to answer a question (or more likely a series of questions). Generally, this question will be quite narrow in scope (for example "Why do loss-of-function mutations in Tussled-Like Kinase 2 lead to learning developmental disorders?"), with the idea that by the end of your PhD, you will be the world expert in your topic. 

**What does a PhD day-to-day look like?**
This is a question that's very difficult to answer, as it will probably be different for every PhD student! I do think there are commonalities though, so I'm planning to write a post about this.

**How many hours a week do you work as a PhD?**
I work about 40 hours a week, but this is probably a conservative estimate. Sometimes I work longer hours, and sometimes I work weekends. [The Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) report 131](https://www.hepi.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PhD-Life_The-UK-Student-Experience_HEPI-Report-131.pdf) on UK PhD student life, published in 2020, is a good source of information on this. This report claims that on average, a PhD student works 47 hours a week.

**How much do you get payed as a PhD student?**
When I first started, I was payed just over £15,000 a year, which was the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) minimum stipend at the time. In the final year of my PhD, I negotiated for a pay rise to just under £18,000 a year, to match the increase in the UKRI minimum stipend. You can get more info on average PhD stipends in [The Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) report 131](https://www.hepi.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PhD-Life_The-UK-Student-Experience_HEPI-Report-131.pdf) on UK PhD student life.

**A PhD sounds great! How do I find/apply for one?**
If you're sure that a PhD is for you, then a great resource is [Find A PhD](https://www.findaphd.com/)! If you want some more info about [how to find a PhD](https://ryanj-ellison.github.io/_04-How-to-find-project-and-funding/) and [how the application process works](https://ryanj-ellison.github.io/_01-Application-process/), I've also made posts about that.
I would recommend doing some research before-hand though to be sure that you want to do a PhD, as it's a big commitment. [Luckily, I've written a post about just that](https://ryanj-ellison.github.io/_02-Four-things-to-consider/)!
