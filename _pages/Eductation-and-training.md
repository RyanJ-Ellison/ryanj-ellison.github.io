## Education
I am currently studying for a PhD in Biomedical Sciences at the University of York (2020-2023). My PhD concerns the roles of growth factor receptors in bladder cancer and how they interact with tumour differentiation status.

I studied for an Undergraduate and Integrated Masters Degree in Biochemistry (MBiochem), at the University of Oxford (2016-2020), where I obtained an Upper Second Class Degree. My masters research project was based in the Lab of [Professor Ulrike Gruneberg](https://www.path.ox.ac.uk/content/ulrike-gruneberg), studying the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint, specifically the action of the protein MAD1.
