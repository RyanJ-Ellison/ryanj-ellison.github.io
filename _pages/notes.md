This page should not be on the main website. This is a place to keep list of ideas and features to add to the website

-- CV --
--------
Rather than taking to a separate page, have this navigation tab just go straight to a PDF or word doc of my CV

-- Resources --
---------------
List of resources useful/relevant to PhD students, such as blogs and youtube channels, books and stuff

-- FAQ --
---------
Not sure if this is actually necessary. But maybe could have questions such as "what is a PhD" (give an explanation), and "how do I find a PhD?" (link to my post on that)

-- To-do--
----------
->Is it possible to add an "RSS feed" style section to my website where I can show my recent substack posts?
