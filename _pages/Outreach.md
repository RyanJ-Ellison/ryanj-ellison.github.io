## Outreach
- **Running "Meet a PhD" Sessions** - Currently I run these sessions in the University of York Biology Department. The idea is to make a space for undergraduate students to come and ask questions about postgraduate study, and get honest answers. We also have free pizza!
- **University Outreach Talks** - I've given several talks on topics such as studying a science degree at university, careers options after a science degree, and what studying for a PhD is actually like. I've previously spoken at Carmel Sixth Form College (St Helens) and Selby College (York).
- **Public Enagement** - I enjoy communicating to the public about the importance of bladder cancer research, and what we actually do! This has included presenting my research to the public at the [York Against Cancer](https://www.yorkagainstcancer.org.uk/) Annual General Meeting, and also spreading awareness of the risk factors of bladder cancer during our Bladder Cancer Awareness Day event.
