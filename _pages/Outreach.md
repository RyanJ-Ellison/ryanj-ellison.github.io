## Outreach
- **Running "Meet a PhD" Sessions** - Currently I run these sessions in the University of York Biology Department. The idea is to make a space for undergraduate students to come and ask questions about postgraduate study, and get honest answers. We also have free pizza!
- **University Outreach Talks** - I've given several talks on topics such as studying a science degree at university, careers options after a science degree, and what studying for a PhD is actually like. I've previously spoken at Carmel Sixth Form College (St Helens) and Selby College (York).
- **Public Enagement** - I enjoy communicating to the public about the importance of bladder cancer research, and what we actually do! This has included presenting my research to the public at the [York Against Cancer](https://www.yorkagainstcancer.org.uk/) Annual General Meeting and their [Volunteer Celebration Day](../images/YAC_Volunteer_Talk.jpeg), as well as spreading awareness of the risk factors of bladder cancer during our Bladder Cancer Awareness Day event.
- **ENTHUSE Schools outreach programme** - Helped to deliver a series of wet lab practicals to students from three Sixth form colleges around York. The practical allowed to students to "diagnose" cancer patients DNA mutations and suggest personalised medicine treatments, using a restrition enzyme digest followed by gel electrophoresis.
