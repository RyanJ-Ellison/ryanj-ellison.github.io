## Research Interests
I began my research journey during my Undergrad at the University of Oxford. I became interested in the fundamental underlying biology of cancers, and how this could be used to target them. I was first able to put this into practice during a placement in the lab of [Professor Eric Cascales](https://www.cascaleslab.fr/) in Marseilles, where I worked to produce genetically engineered E. coli capable of targetting and killing colorectal cancer cells. This work was made possible by a [Laidlaw Scholarship](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/exeter-student-named-laidlaw-scholar-2018/) I was awarded. You can read more about my Laidlaw research project [here](assets/images/Laidlaw-Yearbook-2018-My-Profile.pdf).

I'm currently based at the [Jack Birch Unit](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/jack-birch-unit/) in the [York Biomedical Research Institute](https://www.york.ac.uk/biomedical-research-institute/) of the University of York Biology Department. The Jack Birch Unit studies the epithelial lining of the bladder and urinary tract, called the urothelium. We study the normal biology of the urothelium to understand how it is altered in various disease states, such as bladder cancer.

My research focuses on the role of two specific growth factor receptors, the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3). I'm interested in how the activity of these 2 receptors interacts with and may shape tumour differentiation status. By identifying and dissecting these unique interactions, I aim to adavnce our understanding of fundamental bladder cancer biology. It is my hope that this will inform on the use and mechanism of bladder cancer therapeutics, such at the [use of FGFR3 inhibitors for patients harbouring FGFR3 mutations](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-targeted-therapy-metastatic-bladder-cancer).

I am also interested in how mutations in FGFR3 may contribute to the development of bladder cancer from healthy tissue.

## Education
I am currently studying for a PhD in Biomedical Sciences at the University of York (2020-2023). My PhD concerns the roles of growth factor receptors in bladder cancer and how they interact with tumour differentiation status.

I studied for an Undergraduate and Integrated Masters Degree in Biochemistry (MBiochem), at the University of Oxford (2016-2020), where I obtained an Upper Second Class Degree. My masters research project was based in the Lab of [Professor Ulrike Gruneberg](https://www.path.ox.ac.uk/content/ulrike-gruneberg), studying the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint, specifically the action of the protein MAD1.
