## Hi, welcome to my website!
I’m Ryan, a PhD student at the univeristy of York. I’m a naturally curoius, driven person, with a passion for understanding how things work. As a PhD student, I’m currently researching to try and understand the role of specific mutations in triggering the formation of bladder cancer from healthy tissue. Once the cancer has formed, can these mutations inform us as to how the cancer will behave, for example what treatments it might respond to?

I’m also passionate about science outreach and teaching - I love it when you get a question from someone that shows they’re really engaed in what you’re explaining. When you’re explaining something to a student, it’s very rewarding when you see them have that “Aha!” moment. I have >40 hours of experience as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, teaching in lab practicals, problem classes, and marking reports.
